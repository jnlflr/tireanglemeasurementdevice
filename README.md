# tireanglemeasurementdevice
A device to measure a vehicle's tire angle to the steering angle for accurate steer ratio specification.

# Overview
This project was born out of a need to measure a factual steer ratio for use within Openpilot, an OSS vehicle autonomy platform. The OP planner uses tire angles, which is factored by steer ratio to determine a final steering angle. As you can imagine, factual steering ratios are important.

This device will also determine if a vehicle has Variable Ratio steering.
